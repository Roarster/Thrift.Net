# ThriftSharp.Tests

This library contains all the tests for ThriftSharp. The structure of this project
should follow the structure of the projects it tests. For example, any tests
for `ThriftSharp.Antlr` should go into an `Antlr` folder, and `ThriftSharp.Compilation`
should go into `Compilation`, etc.
