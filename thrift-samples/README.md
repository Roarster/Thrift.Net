# Thrift Samples

This directory contains examples of various different Thrift IDL files that can
be used for testing. The files in the root are intended to illustrate parsing
different types of Thrift definitions (for example Namespaces, Enums, Structs),
and the rest of the files are intended to provide an example of more realistic
Thrift definitions.
