# Thrift.Net

The aim of the Thrift.Net project is to create an implementation of the
[Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) compiler and runtime library in C#,
providing a first class experience for .NET developers wanting to use Thrift.

## License

Thrift.Net is provided under the apache license, which you can find
[here](LICENSE).

## Project Status

At the moment the project is **_not ready for production use_**. We are
currently working on implementing a Thrift compiler that is compatible with the
[official Apache runtime library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ApacheThrift).
Once we have a working compiler, the next step will be to implement the runtime
library to make Thrift.Net self contained.

For information about the initial design goals for the project, see the
[design goals](docs/design-goals.md) page. For information on the project
roadmap, see the [roadmap page](docs/roadmap.md).
